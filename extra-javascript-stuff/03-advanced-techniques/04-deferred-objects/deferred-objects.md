# **Advanced Techniques in JavaScript and jQuery**

## **Deferred Objects**

- jQuery provides an alternate to callbacks for asynchronous processing: Deferred.

- Deferred allow for:

    - Grouping multiple asynchronous processes.

    - Attaching multiple success and failure handlers.

    - Postpone logic flow until all asynchronous processes complete - in any order

    - Integration of AJAX and custom functions into asynchronous processing.
