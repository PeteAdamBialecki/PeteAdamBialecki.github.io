    <caption>Zombie Apocalypse<br><br></caption>
    <p>Let's create a text adventure game with JavaScript.  Let's set a scenario in which we encounter a zombie, choose a weapon to fight the zombie with, and have a 50/50 chance of either defeating the zombie with our weapon, or getting bitten and losing the game.</p>

    <script>
        alert("It is the zombie apocalypse.  You are looting a store and suddenly a zombie bursts through the door!");
            var weapon = prompt("You search around frantically for a weapon.  What do you choose?  A bow and arrow, an axe, or a rubber chicken?");
            var randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random());
        alert("You attack the zombie with your" + " " + weapon);
            if(randomNumber === 0 ){
                alert("The zombie bites you.  You lose!!!");
            } else if (randomNumber === 1 ){
                alert("You kill the zombie with your" + " " + weapon + ". You win!");
