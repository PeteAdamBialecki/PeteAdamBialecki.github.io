## **Querying Relational Databases**

How to structure data in an organized manner.  Benefits of relational databases:

- Maximize storage

- Better application functionality

- Cleaner, richer data for business reporting

## **Normalization**

The process of eliminating redundant or repeating data in a database.

## **UNIQUE Keys**

- Can be null

- Multiple unique keys per table (e.g. email, SSN, etc.)

- Can be modified to a new value

## **PRIMARY Keys**

- Never be null

- One primary key per table

- Cannot be modified to a new value

## **FOREIGN Key**

- Columns designed correctly

- Foreign Key constraint

Extra:

Referential Integrity: FOREIGN key values must also exist as a PRIMARY key value in the reference table.
