# **MONGO.js**

#### **10/20/2018**
- I think that this directory is stable but I completely forgot how to access and run this application.
- I think the next step is to revisit the material and take notes and documentation on how to completely run a Mongo DB.

- Setup Notes: When setting up MongoDB, use these helpful links.  This works with OSX 10.11.6 El Capitan, Xcode 8, and MongoDB 3.4.
